Strat #3
$0.20 = 2/3/1,4/1,4 [in this instance the naked play would be a more
  2                              or less 'blind' bet on Fav-est 4 runners hoping to
  3                             maximize payoff by placing Fav in 3rd & 4th slots
  1,4                         or in addition to $0.80 #1 play to give it omph if it hits]
